# Voter-Turnout-Modeling-and-Predictive-Analysis

## Project Overview
In the United States, voter turnout plays a critical role in shaping election outcomes and public policy. Since voting is voluntary, understanding patterns in voter participation, particularly where turnout is low—can guide efforts to improve voter outreach and increase participation. This project focuses on performing essential data engineering and data visualization using ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Notebooks to prepare and analyze voter turnout data, with the goal of predicting future turnout patterns.

Data is sourced from the Harvard Dataverse and the United States Census Bureau, featuring voter turnout figures for each U.S. county during presidential elections from 2000 to 2020.

## The Challenge
Voter participation is often uneven, with some areas consistently seeing lower turnout than others. Various socio-economic, demographic, and historical factors can impact a community’s likelihood to vote. The challenge is to accurately model these trends and develop a framework to analyze voter turn out and predict where turnout might be low in future elections. By identifying these areas, they can better target efforts to increase voter participation.

## Goal and Objective
The goal of this project is to prepare and analyze voter turnout data, with the goal of predicting future turnout patterns.

- Understand historical voter turnout trends across U.S. counties from 2000 to 2020.
- Identify key factors and socio-economic indicators that influence voter turnout.
- Build a data pipeline that supports the extraction, transformation, and analysis of voter turnout data.
- Create visualizations to help communicate these insights and trends.
- Use predictive modeling techniques to forecast turnout and highlight areas with potential low participation, aiding in the development of targeted outreach strategies.
